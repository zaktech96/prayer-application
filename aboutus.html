    <p class="about_product">
      We are pleased to introduce Alwaqt, Alwaqt prayers app is a google
      chrome extension which displays prayer times depending on your location.
      Alwaqt translates roughly to time in Arabic. It also has a counter so
      you can keep track of how many times you have prayed. This project aims
      at creating a world where every Muslim can pray on time and be used by
      many Muslims around the world. The software
      will allow different screen sizes from mobile to desktop and bigger
      monitor screens which display prayer times depending on your location,
      so you can practice your prayers and stay connected with them. We look
      to create one of the best prayer applications as google chrome
      extensions, by using modern and dynamic designs.

        I have enjoyed the up and downs along the way of learning so much more than expected.
         Being able to build this project increased my experience in front-end development by leaps and bounds.</p>

<!-- <p>
  I am Zakariye and my partner in this project, Ibrahim is the other person who helped create this project. This project is something that was made as an idea as we wanted to learn more about the topic and make a project which relates to me and others. The idea came about as I felt I needed to make a project which related to my daily life as I am a Muslim and pray so, therefore, doing stuffing related to my life and others will benefit others. It all started when Ibrahim contacted me to have a chat about some advice about the tech industry and I invited him onto the project. 
Having Ibrahim on this project, he brought some great insights such as working on Figma in order to bring this project to life. Pair programming has allowed us to learn from each other and make us understand that together many great things can happen instead of doing it alone. We communicated this project very well and hear we are launching our project to the world which I believe will not only benefit us but will benefit other Muslims In sha Allah
