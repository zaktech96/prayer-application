        <p class="about_product">
          We are pleased to introduce Alwaqat, Alwaqat prayers app is a google
          chrome extension which displays prayer times depending on your location.
          Alwaqat translates roughly to time in Arabic. It also has a counter so
          you can keep track of how many times you have prayed. This project aims
          at creating a world where every Muslim can pray on time and be used by
          many Muslims around the world. The software
          will allow different screen sizes from mobile to desktop and bigger
          monitor screens which display prayer times depending on your location,
          so you can practice your prayers and stay connected with them. We look
          to create one of the best prayer applications as google chrome
          extensions, by using modern and dynamic designs.

              From not knowing much about tech, to reaching out to a fellow developer and having him sit down with me were the first steps in my journey. 
                I have enjoyed the up and downs along the way of learning so much more than expected. I learned to be more organized and efficient with my time, do not get discouraged by setbacks, always look for advice from others and not rely on yourself alone, collaborate as much as possible because it helps everyone become more knowledgeable and much more confident.
                Being able to build this project increased my experience in front-end development by leaps and bounds.</p>

            <p class="col_text">Hi, My name is Ibrahim and I am a self taught web developer. 
              I've had a keen eye in design since 
            and have always been fascinated with how things 
              are built and how they work.
              Working on this project has allowed me to utilise my strengths
               and improve my pair programming skills with the completion of this project. This project
               will allow me to use this knowledge  in the future. Working on a real-world project can present unique challenges that may not be covered in a typical programming course. I  have learned how to approach and solve problems creatively, as well as how to debug and troubleshoot issues that arise during development.
