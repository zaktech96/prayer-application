          Introducing Alwaqat - a responsive prayer app designed to help Muslims pray on time. Available as a Google Chrome extension, Alwaqat displays prayer times based on your location and includes a prayer counter to help you keep track of your daily prayers. Our goal is to create a world where every Muslim has access to accurate prayer times and can perform their prayers on time. Alwaqat is optimized for both large and small screens, making it easy to use on any device.

              reaching out to a fellow developer and enjoying the ups and
